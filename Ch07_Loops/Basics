<while>
while(condition){
  body
}

*if the condition is T -> execute the body
                     F -> skip


<for>
for(initializer;condition;update){

}

*initializer: once ran
condition: checked each time
update: at the end of each iteration
*the variable declared in the initializer only exists inside the for loop!

** While & For : pretest loops
;test the condition first & at the beginning


<Do-While>
*:posttest loop
->useful when need to run the body at least once
